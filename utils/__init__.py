# This is the __init__.py file for the 'my_package' package.
# 
# Python treats directories containing an __init__.py file as packages.
# This file can be used to define package-level attributes, perform
# package initialization, and organize related modules within the package.
#
# It allows you to create a modular and organized namespace for your code.
# Import statements in this file can make package modules accessible
# when you import 'my_package' in other parts of your Python project.
